## React OpenLayers WebGL boilerplate for MET frontend applications

This repository contains a development version of a MET boilerplate using OpenLayers and WebGL technologies.
For the official MET boilerplate visit https://gitlab.met.no/team-frontend/react-ts-boilerplate .

You may install and run this development boilerplate as follows.

      git clone https://github.com/FrankThomasTveter/boilerplate
      # git remote set-url origin https://github.com/MyOwnUser/boilerplate
      # git config credential.helper store
      cd boilerplate
      npm install
      npm start

## Getting Started with MET boilerplate

This boilerplate should give you a good starting point when developing new frontend applications for MET.

The Material-UI theme is an implementation of MET visual profile. Most of the code is there to provide examples on
how to implement apps with React in typescript.

There is a [google chat group](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAw78xu_c) where we discuss React development at MET.
You can also contact it-team-frontend@met.no for more information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
